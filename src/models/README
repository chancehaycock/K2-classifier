#       MODEL WORKFLOW
# =============================

# Data Prep
# ==========
# 0) GAIA Data - gaia_crossmatch.py 
# 1) period file - Obtain from SJH
# 2) phasefold - needs 1) - phasefold.py
# 3) lightcurve_stats - needs 2) - lightcurve_statistics.py
# 4) Create MASTER table - needs 0), 1), 2), 3) and armstrong_0-4.csv
#    Master table shouldn't need to be changed once created 

# Model Setup
# ===========

# 5) Make Training set (list of epics, class, probabilities) - make_training_set.py
# 6) Obtain cluster centres from plot of training set in make_som.py
#    Can do this by setting test_campaign_num flag == -1
# 7) Use make_som.py with found clusters to create SOM_statistics.py
